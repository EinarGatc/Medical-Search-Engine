An abdominal aortic aneurysm is an enlarged area in the lower part of the body's main artery, called the aorta. The aorta runs 
from the heart through the center of the chest and belly area, called the abdomen. 

Abdominal aortic aneurysms often grow slowly without noticeable symptoms. This makes them difficult to detect. Some aneurysms never 
rupture. Many start small and stay small. Others grow larger over time, sometimes quickly.

Aneurysms can develop anywhere along the aorta. Most aortic aneurysms occur in the part of the aorta that's in the belly area, 
called the abdomen. Several things can lead to the development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, including: 

Aortic aneurysms also increase the risk of developing blood clots in the area. If a blood clot breaks loose from the inside wall 
of an aneurysm, it can block a blood vessel elsewhere in the body. Symptoms of a blocked blood vessel may include pain or 
reduced blood flow to the legs, toes, kidneys or belly area.
